# final_project

For the final assignment, we have created a simple shooting game using p5.js library. All the graphic elements have been created using the functions defined in p5.js . In the game, there is a rectangle that we have named the shooter which will shoot bullets at the enemies which are essentially ellipses. Bullets can be shot using the space key and the left and right arrow key can be used to move the shooter left or right. Code has been added to make sure the enemies and the shooter dont move out of the canvas by checking for the position of the different elements. When the bullet hits the enemy, both the elements are removed from the canvas. For every hit, 2 points are added to the score. There is a timer of 30 seconds at the start, and after that time ends, the speed of the enemies will increase, time will be decreased by one, and this will keep going on.
